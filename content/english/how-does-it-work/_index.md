## Knowspace

{{< notice "Knowing is caring" >}}
Residents go about their daily routines and Knowspace handles the rest.  Elopement notifications, fall detection and more.
{{< /notice >}}

1. Inside the facility, residents are "in the green" and may move about as they like
2. Once a resident crosses an attention boundary, staff are alerted to a potential elopement
3. If a resident leaves the elopement perimeter, Knowspace escalates to an alarm status.
